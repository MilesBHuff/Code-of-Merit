# Code of Merit

1. The project creator(s)/lead developer(s)/core team constitute the managing
member(s) of this project and collectively have the final say in every matter
of the project, technical or otherwise -- and this includes overturning previous
decisions. There are no limitations to this power.

2. Authority or position in the project will be proportional to an individual's
overall contribution and time on the project -- seniority must be earned.

3. Technically superior implementations should replace technically inferior
implementations. This such technical advantage is the single most-important
metric for code in this project.

4. In this space, there is room only for raw technical prowess; any topics
beyond the scope of the project will not be tolerated.

5. Non-technical conflicts will be discussed in a separate space, and will not
be allowed to disrupt the project.

6. Individual characteristics -- including, but not limited to, body, sex,
sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality, or political
preferences -- are irrelevant in the scope of the project and will not be taken
into account concerning your value or that of your contribution to the project.

7. Discuss or debate the idea, not the person -- period.

8. There is no room for ambiguity: ambiguity will be met with questioning;
further ambiguity will be met with silence. It is the responsibility
of the originator to provide requested context.

9. This Code of Conduct governs the technical procedures of the project, and
has no bearing on any activity outside it.

10. Participation in this project equates to agreement to this Code of Conduct.

11. No objectives beyond the stated objectives of this project are relevant
to the project. Any intent to deviate the project from its original purpose
of existence will constitute grounds for remedial action which may include
expulsion from the project.
